=======
This 201code repo is for **201n15 class code.** I will update this project as we will be moving ahead.
It is going to be very ***interesting!***

## Contents
We will see how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to create, style and rend a website functionable and useful to users.
So in this project, we will see and discuss:
* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT.  

After we will see them on work, in a website that I intend to create and include all of what I will be learning.
___Thank you. Hope to see you ahead!___

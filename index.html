    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello. Glad to have you here. My Name is James, and I am new     to coding. That is why I am taking classes at Code Fellows, and now I am     in class 201 which is <strong><em>Foundations to Software Development</em></strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>So Who Really Am I?</h2>
           <!--Talking about my Likes!-->
    <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. I      like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the        moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my       face. I like to look at the bluesky becuase it makes me think    about how beautiful the nature is, I like to sleep early, I      like to get up late; I sometimes like to be alone it helps me    a lot when I need to think on something,and I like to be         surrounded by people becuase I like to laugh. I like to          listen country music and like to watch romantic movies. But      above of all, <strong>I LIKE TO PRAY GOD, READ THE BIBLE      AND LISTEN TO GOSPEL MUSIC!</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Country I Am Coming From</h2>
    <!--Here I am describing the country I am coming from-->
    <img src= "Rwanda_Kigali_Convention_Center.jpg">
    <p>I was born in Rwanda, a small country in East Africa, mostly      known as <strong>"A thousand Hills Country"</strong>. Rwanda is surrounded by         Uganda in North, Tanzania in West, Burundi in South and           D.R.Congo in East. Rwanda is a small country of 12 millions       people on an area of 26,338 sq km *(7 times smaller that           Washington!)*.</br>
    
      Rwanda has a temperate tropical highland climate, with lower temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries due to its high elevation.</br>
      In Rwanda, we speak 4 languages: Kinyarwanda, English, French and Swahili. (<em>I am learning English, but i do speak fluently the 3 other languages!</em>).

    <p>I come from a family of 6 children; 1 brother and 4 sisters. I    live with my beautifull wife and our 3 kids; 2 daughters and      2-month old little boy!

    <main>
      <p>Hello! Welcome to My website. Being here means you have   
        passed all my questions.<br>
        Now sit firmly and enjoy <strong>Coding.</strong> We will start by talking about 3 major web development tools: <em> HMTL,CSS and JS.</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><h2>HTML</h2></li>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language.</strong> It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. In o ther words, HTML is used to desrcibe what will be included on a website page or pages (texts, images, sketchs, audios, videos). Now we are on HTML version 5 a.k.a HTML5, which is the one I am using for this project!
        </p>

        <li><h2>CSS</h2></li>
        <p>
          <strong>Style Cascading Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. Now we are on CSS3.
        </p>

        <li><h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2></li>
        <p>
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br>
          JS lets the web developers design interactive sites. Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to JS, which augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.
